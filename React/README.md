SimpleSite examples

This folder contains two implementations of the same simple design:

1) static-html/ - Plain HTML pages (index.html and about.html) with `styles.css`.
   To view: open `static-html/index.html` in a browser.

2) react-app/ - Minimal Create React App-style project with components and routing.
   Quick start:
     cd react-app
     npm install
     npm start

Both versions share a simple header, navigation, hero section and footer.
