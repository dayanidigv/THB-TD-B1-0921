Simple React Site (CRA-style)

This is a minimal Create React App style structure with routing and simple components.

Quick start:

1. cd react-app
2. npm install
3. npm start

Notes:
- This repo uses `react-scripts` commands in package.json. If you don't have Create React App setup, installing dependencies will include them.
- The app provides two routes: `/` (Home) and `/about` (About).
