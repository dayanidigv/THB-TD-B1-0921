# What is Node.js?

## 🤔 Definition

Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime** built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, outside of a web browser.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. **JavaScript Everywhere**
- Use the same language for frontend and backend
- Share code between client and server

### 2. **Non-Blocking I/O**
- Asynchronous operations
- Can handle many operations at once
- Perfect for I/O-heavy applications

### 3. **Fast Execution**
- Built on V8 engine (super fast!)
- Compiles JavaScript to machine code

### 4. **NPM Ecosystem**
- Largest package ecosystem in the world
- Over 1 million packages available

## 🎯 What Can You Build?

- ✅ Web servers and APIs
- ✅ Real-time applications (chat, games)
- ✅ Command-line tools
- ✅ Microservices
- ✅ Database operations
- ✅ File system operations
- ✅ Streaming applications

## ❌ What Node.js is NOT Good For

- ❌ CPU-intensive operations (complex calculations)
- ❌ Heavy data processing
- ❌ Video encoding/processing

## 🔑 Core Concepts

1. **Single-Threaded**: Uses one main thread with event loop
2. **Event-Driven**: Responds to events and callbacks
3. **Asynchronous**: Non-blocking operations

## 🆚 Node.js vs Browser JavaScript

| Feature | Browser | Node.js |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Environment | Client-side | Server-side |
| Global Object | `window` | `global` |
| DOM Access | Yes | No |
| File System | Limited | Full access |
| Modules | ES6 modules | CommonJS + ES6 |

## 🚀 Why Learn Node.js?

1. **High Demand**: Many job opportunities
2. **JavaScript Skills**: Leverage existing JS knowledge
3. **Modern**: Used by Netflix, LinkedIn, Uber, PayPal
4. **Community**: Large, active community
5. **Full-Stack**: Become a full-stack developer
